# What did you learn about GitHub and project planning?

- I learnt that it is very important to plan and use github when working on a repository. It helps manage the tasks that are neede to be done
as well as managing the resources needed. I liked the issues and project features Github has. I think without github it will be easy to lose track
of the code and who did what and when. I learnt also to commit changes frequently to avoid losing my work.

# What was challenging or fun? If you had more time, what would you improve?

- This was very fun for me because it allowed me to be creative. My initial idea was to have a simple list of satellites orbitting earth, but I found about an api that returns locations of these satellites.
I searched a way to vizualise them and i found the globe model package. It was challenging setting it up but it turned out nice. To improve, I would spend more time planning and detailing the issues better
so that during development the goals are clear.
